                <p><strong>Supplier Rebrand Requirement:</strong> Our key suppliers required cessation of operations under this brand name due to potential confusion with fraudulent operators using similar names.

                <p><strong>The Compliance & Litigation Clearinghouse (MJuris) was the centralized legal execution function of Road and Rescue Ltd.</strong> Operating across all jurisdictions, MJuris was responsible for processing, enforcement, and closure of disputes relating to:</p>
                <ul style="margin-top: 10px;">
                    <li>Contract breaches and terms violations</li>

                <h3>Reason for Brand Closure</h3>
                <p><strong>Our key suppliers and corporate partners required us to rebrand due to ongoing market confusion with fraudulent companies using similar names.</strong> This was not solely our decision - our major suppliers stipulated they would not continue working under a brand name that could be confused with known scam operations.</p>
                <p>Despite our legitimate global operations and strong performance metrics, our suppliers' reputational concerns regarding name similarity to "Safer Road Rescue" and other fraudulent operators made continuation under this brand impossible.</p>
                <p><strong>Key suppliers cited association risks</strong> as incompatible with their own brand protection requirements, forcing the closure of operations under the "Road and Rescue" name.</p>

            <div class="closure-notice">
                <p><strong>For Customers & Suppliers:</strong> All outstanding matters have been resolved through direct communication. MJuris (clx@roadandrescue.com) handled all final contract enforcement and compliance matters prior to closure.</p>
                <p><strong>For Corporate Partners:</strong> Your relationships continue seamlessly under our new global brand. Direct communications have been sent regarding transition arrangements.</p>
