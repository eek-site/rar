            <!-- 1. IMMEDIATE NOTICE - What happened -->
            <p><strong>Road and Rescue Ltd</strong> has discontinued the "Road and Rescue" brand as of July 2025. <strong>The company continues to operate under a new global brand to support our key suppliers and maintain our corporate partnerships.</strong></p>
            
            <!-- 2. SCAM DISTINCTION - Critical for reputation -->
            <div class="distinction-box">
                <h3>‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT BRAND DISTINCTION</h3>
                <p><strong>Road and Rescue is NOT affiliated with "Safer Road Rescue."</strong> While both companies operated dispatch models, we are completely separate entities.</p>
                <p><strong>"Safer Road Rescue" has been widely reported as a fraudulent operation</strong> that takes customer payments without providing adequate service or misrepresents their services to both customers and partner companies.</p>
                <p><strong>Road and Rescue operated as a legitimate business</strong> with proper service delivery, fair pricing, and ethical business practices.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="corporate-notice">
                <h3>üè¢ BUSINESS CONTINUITY NOTICE</h3>
                <p><strong>All existing corporate provider relationships and insurance company partnerships remain fully intact and continue under a separate global brand.</strong> The business continues to operate to support our key suppliers and maintain established partnerships.</p>
                <p>Our relationships with fleet managers, rideshare operators, insurance brokers, and commercial partners across the UK, NZ, US, Australia, Canada, Brazil, Chile, and Honduras are unaffected by this brand closure.</p>
                <p><strong>Supplier Support:</strong> Operations continue under the new brand identity to maintain our supplier network and honor all existing commercial commitments.</p>
                <p>Corporate clients and suppliers will be contacted directly regarding continuation of services under the new brand identity.</p>
            </div>

            <!-- 4. WHY THIS HAPPENED - Explanation -->
            <div class="warning-box">
                <h3>Reason for Brand Discontinuation</h3>
                <p><strong>Our key suppliers and corporate partners required us to discontinue the "Road and Rescue" brand due to ongoing market confusion with fraudulent companies using similar names.</strong> This was not solely our decision - our major suppliers stipulated they would not continue working under a brand name that could be confused with known scam operations.</p>
                <p>Despite our legitimate global operations and strong performance metrics, our suppliers' reputational concerns regarding name similarity to "Safer Road Rescue" and other fraudulent operators made continuation under this brand impossible.</p>
                <p><strong>Key suppliers cited association risks</strong> as incompatible with their own brand protection requirements, forcing the discontinuation of the "Road and Rescue" brand name.</p>

                <p><strong>Road and Rescue maintained a global supplier network operating under comprehensive contractual terms.</strong> These terms remain in full effect as Road and Rescue Ltd continues operations under the new brand.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Key Continuing Supplier Obligations:</strong></p>
                <ul style="margin-top: 10px;">
                    <li><strong>Ongoing Network Participation:</strong> Suppliers remain part of the global network with continued public representation under the new brand</li>
                    <li><strong>Non-Competition Restrictions:</strong> 2-year prohibition on competing or soliciting customers continues to apply post-brand change</li>
                    <li><strong>Confidentiality Obligations:</strong> Strict restrictions on financial disclosures and sharing payment information remain binding</li>
